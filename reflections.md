## As you stated in the week 2 content in regards to the Terminal:

1. The terminal is a text-based interface used with one's computer.
1. The terminal can run other text-based programs.
1. You described this as a command-line interface for interacting with Git version control systems.
1. The terminal is an alternative to the GUI.
1. You need to install a shell program for the terminal.
    - In Windows you use Zshell. (Bash is often the most commonly used)
    - This is thought of as the "operating system"

## Why might we care?

1. The terminal lets us do things quicker by entering automatically executed commands.
1. Using the terminal you can track changes in your code, load previous versions, upload to a repository, and pull from a repository.

## What is Git / GitHub?

> [!NOTE]
> **GitHub**, Inc. is an AI-powered developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code.

1. GitHub is a remote repository
   - You can use it especially well for collaboration (allowing people to upload their code from their desktop to the repository and you pull their code etc).

>[!NOTE]
>**Git** is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different computers).

2. Git is a version control system that people use to keep track of changes, manage code, work with multiple developers etc.
   - Essentially, it is really useful for coding/managing code.
   - You can change files or directories directly and you can also pull/push from git or your own local repositories using Git.

## How do I anticipate these tools will help someone working as a developer?

1. Easy colaboration. Using the aforementioned items can streamline progress, updates, rollbacks, suggestions, and bug fixes.
2. Easy documentation and revision of changes.
3. Easy information changing.
4. Easy storing and transferring of information.
5. Protection from loss of work.
6. Can make work accessible from anywhere.
